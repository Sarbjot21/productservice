## Project Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the E-commerce sample backend project:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

    ```terminal
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/e-commerce-backend.git
    ```
    

2. **Open the Project in Visual Studio Code**: Open Visual Studio Code, and use the "Open Folder" option to select the project's root directory.

3. **Install Dependencies**: Visual Studio Code may prompt you to install Java and Maven extensions; please do so. Additionally, make sure the mentioned extensions are installed.

4. **Edit Configuration (Optional)**: If you need to modify any project-specific configuration, you can do so in the `application.properties` or `application.yml` files, typically located in the `src/main/resources` directory.

5. **Build and Run the Project**:
- Open the integrated terminal in Visual Studio Code.
- Run the following command to build and start the Spring Boot application:

  ```
  mvn spring-boot:run
  ```

- The application will start on the default port (usually 8080). You can access the API documentation and test the endpoints by visiting `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`.

6. **Exploring the Code**: You can start exploring the project's code in the `src/main/java` directory, where the main application class, controllers, services, and models are located.
